    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    5F:2D:00:33:1D:BC:E4:B5:58:8F:E1:8F:45:ED:D9:C3:F6:9F:40:85

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
